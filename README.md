# NoSideTorch
Minecraft Plugin to keep players from Side Torching.

Side torching is the placement of a torch on the side of a block that is directly above a block.  Ground torches are good, Wall torches are good.  Side torching is bad. 

# NoSideTorch.java file
This file is the java code of the plugin.  You can see the code that is behind the plug in. 

# me.SgtCMofo.NoSideTorch-1.0.jar
This is the actual plugin you drop into the /plugins folder on the server.  Once you upload it to the server in the server console type "reload" and it will reload the plugins and this should start.  

A message in the server console should say "No Side Torch plugin Started"

And when you stop the server a message will display "No Side Torch plugin is stopped."

Any updates/suggestions just let me know.
